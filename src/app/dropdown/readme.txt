KNOWN ISSUES
- ng2 custom html tag "<seach-renderer>" actually inhibits input flex management wich would span on residual space

MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS
- full keyboard management (option selection, choices remove, ...)
- different search modes (whole loading, remote api call, ...)
- search remoting, debouncing and optimizations (eg if previous search string leaded to no results was included in the current don't perform search)
- ...
